<h2 style="color:#b35900;font-family:cursive;font-size:300%;text-align:center;">Just kidding! But there was once a girl, me, who was born on November 28, 2000. I love my family with all my heart and as I grew up I found a fondness for learning new things, but as I went into highschool my fondness soon turned into a passion for computer science, which I still have today in my Junior year. I hope to continue on into a career in becoming a computer science teacher and I can't wait for the challenge!</h2>
